# cmdrs-log-continued
A successor to Cmdr's Log, a trading companion for Elite: Dangerous made by ArchV1 who has gotten too busy with life to continue his work. So I've picked up the legacy, but with no source code I've started from scratch. This is a bug tracking, feature suggesting and release repo.
